# THOR: Text-enabled Humanitarian Operations in Real Time #
The THOR (Text-enabled Humanitarian Operations in Real-time) framework, funded under the DARPA LORELEI program, is designed to provide humanitarian and disaster relief planners superior situation awareness through visual and analytical data science.

# This Repo: Customized Document Feed Based on Multi-class Multi-label Classification #
This repo records the files related to Customized Document Feed Based on Multi-class Multi-label Classification, which is a subproblem belongs to the THOR project.  

## Objective ##
With natural disaster related massive documents come from various kinds of sources such as social network, online news and articles, etc., we aim to build a framework that can classify these documents into multiple themes, and feed them to related disaster relief organizations.  
A sample classification looks like the this (a document classified into four themes):

This project is challenging and unique because:  
1. It is a multi-class multi-label classification task, which is much harder than binary or multi-class single-label classification tasks.  
2. The amount of data we received from DARPA is massive and unique. It contains millions of disaster-related documents that cannot be found anywhere else.  
3. We build advanced models to solve this challenge. They include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Information Retrieval, Knowledge Graph, etc.
